QUESTIONS:
  - Make status changed to claim not re-set date_time_completed
BUGS:

IDEAS:
  - we'll need to write some scripts eventually that disable users who haven't logged in for a long period of time
  - Erica H. Pls create a feature that can be accessed frm inside any file called additional billing - I have found many files that were never billed bc our supplement dept forgot to bill a file & pay an appr add'l $ because they have no way to monitor those files. I monitor them by opening another tab in my browser, but not everyone does that and that can clutter the desktop afterawhile. this will help us stop losing $

MUSIC:
  - Dispatch
